# pionier-network-config
This repository contains the engineering thesis project focused on configuring a computer network based on the PIONIER national fiber-optic network in Poland. The project covers network topology design, configuration of network devices, and implementation of key network services to ensure efficient and secure data transmission.

Key Features:
- Development of a logical and physical network architecture using PIONIER infrastructure.
- Setup of routers, switches, and other network components.
- Implementation of routing protocols, VLANs, and security mechanisms.
- Optimization and testing of network performance and security measures.

Technologies Used:
- Cisco network devices
- Linux-based network configuration
- Routing protocols (OSPF)
- VLAN, VoIP, ACL and NAT configurations
