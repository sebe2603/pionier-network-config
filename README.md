# PIONIER Network Configuration

This repository contains an engineering thesis project focused on configuring a computer network based on the **PIONIER** national fiber-optic infrastructure in Poland. The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure and efficient network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design a logical and physical network topology inspired by the PIONIER backbone.
- Configure networking devices such as routers and switches.
- Implement key network services and protocols to ensure secure and optimized data transmission.
- Simulate and test network performance using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Network topology based on the PIONIER infrastructure.
- Configuration of routers, switches, and end devices.
- Implementation of:
  - OSPF routing protocol
  - VLAN segmentation
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - Network Address Translation (NAT)
  - VoIP integration
- Simulation of network performance and security features.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Routing Protocols**: OSPF
- **Network Services**: VLAN, VoIP, ACL, NAT
